Portfolio Website – Git Bash & GitHub Project
Introduction

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Git version control using Git Bash and GitHub.
The objective of the project is to understand how source code is tracked, managed, and maintained efficiently during software development.
A personal portfolio website was chosen as the project because it represents a real-world application and allows multiple meaningful changes, making it suitable for demonstrating Git operations such as commits, branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

Git Commands Used

During the development of this project, the following Git commands were used to manage the source code and track changes:

git init – to initialize a local Git repository

git status – to check the state of the working directory

git add – to stage changes for committing

git commit – to save changes with meaningful messages

git branch – to create and manage multiple branches

git checkout – to switch between branches

git merge – to combine changes from different branches

git push – to upload local commits to GitHub

git pull – to synchronize changes from the remote repository

These commands helped maintain a clean and structured development workflow.

Branches Created

To demonstrate effective branching strategies, the following branches were created:

feature – used to add new features to the project

test – used to test modifications without affecting the main code

bugfix – used to fix layout and functionality issues

experiment – used to try alternative design and styling ideas

Each branch served a specific purpose and was later merged into the master branch, ensuring controlled and organized development.

Merge Conflict

A merge conflict was intentionally created by modifying the same HTML heading in two different branches.
When attempting to merge these branches, Git was unable to automatically resolve the conflict.
The conflict was then resolved manually by reviewing the conflicting changes, selecting the appropriate version, and committing the resolved file.
This process provided hands-on experience in handling real-world collaboration conflicts.

Conclusion

This project significantly improved the understanding of version control systems and collaborative development workflows.
By implementing Git commands, branching strategies, merge operations, and conflict resolution, the project provided valuable practical experience.
Additionally, the portfolio website serves as a professional digital profile that showcases technical skills and projects, making it useful for academic and career purposes.
